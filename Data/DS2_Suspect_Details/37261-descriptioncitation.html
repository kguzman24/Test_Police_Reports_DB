		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> This project examined the role of sexual assault medical forensic exams (sexual assault kits) and other case characteristics in achieving investigative and prosecutorial outcomes in sexual assault cases. The study team conducted comprehensive reviews of over 500 sexual assault cases based on reports to police to identify evidence and case characteristics as they progress through case processing. Using statistical models, the study team predicted case outcomes using a variety of case, suspect, and victim characteristics, with a focus on the role of sexual assault exams and kits. Additionally, the study team interviewed key stakeholders in each site to supplement the case-level information, including law enforcement, prosecutors, representatives from victim service agencies, and sexual assault nurse examiners.</span></p>

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> The goal of this study is to further the research on the sexual assault medical forensic exam's (SAMFE)
impact on case processing and decision making beyond forensic DNA evidence. This work involved two jurisdictions from a northeastern state and used both
qualitative and quantitative data collection methods.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> <p>The quantitative data collection focused on case file reviews of 534 sexual assault cases. Cases were coded prospectively from the time they were reported to law enforcement through
case disposition (whether referred to prosecution or not). Case coders had an existing connection (i.e., as
either interns/consultants or employees) to participating local law enforcement and prosecution agencies
and had access to the relevant local data systems and partners needed to detect study-eligible cases and
track progress. Coders monitored case eligibility and processing over time and recorded information about case progression into an online, secure, confidential database created by the Urban Institute.</p>
<p> The study team computed simple frequencies and probabilities of a
case progressing to each stage of the criminal justice and forensic evidence processes, both overall and
conditional on having progressed to the previous stage. The study team conducted a
series of logistic regressions to estimate the relationship between a case having an SAMFE and three
criminal justice outcomes: whether a suspect was identified, arrested, and/or convicted. The study team also selected
several covariates to include in the models based on case, victim, and/or suspect characteristics identified in
prior research as being predictive of these case outcomes.</p></span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> Quantitative data collection focused on case file reviews of 534 sexual assault cases (n=226 from
jurisdiction 1 and n=308 from jurisdiction 2). Criteria for a case to be included in the sample included: (1) the
suspect was an adult, (2) the victim was age 13 or older,6 and (3) the case had an initial charge recorded by
the police related to sexual misconduct and assault within the state's statute.</span></p>
								<div><strong>Time Method:</strong> <p>Cross-sectional</p></div>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> Sexual assault cases reported to police with suspects processed in the adult court system and victims over the age of 12.</span></p>
